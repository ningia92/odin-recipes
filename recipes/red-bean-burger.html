    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you want to taste something delicious and homemade, without giving up the pleasure of a burger, which is typically eaten outside, try this delicious recipe and be ready to change your mind. They are very tasty and also excellent for filling a nice sandwich, perhaps with a little hummus, tomato and caramelized onions, as I did.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>280g Cooked red beans</li>
        <li>250g Grilled peppers</li>
        <li>3/4 Tablespoons breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons sautéed onion</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven in static mode at 220 °C. Pour the red beans into a blender. Add the grilled and chopped peppers, onion, chopped parsley, paprika and soy sauce. Finish with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Chop but not completely: as soon as the consistency seems malleable, stop, so that the burgers maintain a slightly grainy consistency. Transfer the mixture just obtained into a bowl and add the breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>As soon as the mixture becomes malleable, start creating the burgers with your hands and place them on a baking tray lined with baking paper. Grease them with a drizzle of oil and cook in a static oven for about 20 minutes, turning them halfway through cooking. In the end you should get burgers that are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.</li>
    </ol>
